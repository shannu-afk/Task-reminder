## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration & Customization

- **Session Secret Key:**  
  Make sure to set a secure `app.secret_key` in your `__init__.py`.

- **In-Memory Storage:**  
  For demo, user and task data are stored in Python dictionaries and will reset when the app restarts.  
  To persist data, connect to a database (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL).

- **Voice Reminder:**  
  - Only works on browsers that support the [Web Speech API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechSynthesis).
  - For the reminder to work, the browser tab must be open and have sound enabled.
